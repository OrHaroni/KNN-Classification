# Advanced Program Project Exercise #2

***WE HAVE ACCIDENTELY OVERWRITTEN THIS BRANCH WHILE WORKING ON EX3. WE ONLY ADDED CLASSES(SERVER AND CLIENT) AND DIDNT TOUCH THE PREVIUS CLASSES AND FILES.
AFTER MAILING YOAV, WE ARE ADDING LINK TO THE LAST COMMIT OF EX2: https://github.com/OrHaroni/AdvancedProgProject/tree/c58898bf8e87ee46adc9995c00df9fef47cd807c
THANK YOU FOR YOUR CONSIDERATION***

The program expects from the user to insert vector with valid length (4,8,12 by the majority of the file the program has been opened).
