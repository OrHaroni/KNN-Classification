# AdvancedProgProject
We made a program that check the distance bitween vectors with five diffrent furmulas.
how to compile?
g++ main.cpp distance.h distance.cpp
./a.out
We made utilits by making only 3 function for the 5 furmulas.
this was possible because of that the the Euclidean and Minkowski use the same
formula when p = 2.
And manhatten is the same just with p=1.
So we could made a function do deal with them just with diffrent p value.
We also made sure to deal with end cases like letter in the vectors or vector of diffrent sizes.
We made a main function to deal with getting the vectors and the end cases and the there is the disstance file 
and header to calculate the actual distanc.
